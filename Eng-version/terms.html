                                                <br><br>

                                                the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
                                                processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to
                                                justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal
                                                Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object
                                                to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To
                                                learn whether we are processing Personal Information for direct

                                                (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
                                                processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances include:
                                                the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we
                                                must verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the
                                                erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction of its
                                                use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for the
                                                purposes of processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or
                                                defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing pending the
                                                verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate
                                                grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such Personal Information
                                                will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, will be
                                                processed only with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise
                                                or defense of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another
                                                natural, or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.

                                                erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances
                                                include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to
                                                the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you
                                                withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
                                                processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
                                                processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have
                                                been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to
                                                erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right
                                                of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal
                                                obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal
                                                claims.

                                                (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you
                                                have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
                                                format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
                                                controller without any hindrance from us, provided that such
                                                transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
                                                others.

                                                <br><br>

                                                websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
                                                tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
                                                connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
                                                collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or
                                                visit a website or online service as they move across different websites
                                                over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
                                                uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to
